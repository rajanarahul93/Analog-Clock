How It Works
The clock hands are dynamically updated every second based on the current time. The hour, minute, and second hands are positioned and rotated accordingly to represent the current time.

Usage
Simply open the index.html file in your web browser to view the analog clock. The clock hands will continuously update to reflect the current time.

Feel free to customize the clock face background and styles in the style.css file.
